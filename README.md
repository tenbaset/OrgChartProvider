# OrgChartProvider
.Net WebAPI based provider of information for OrgChart

Designed for enterprise environments, you need only implement a reasonably
simple interface for you data set (IInfoProvider).  Am working on an 
Active Directory based provider.

Uses <a href="https://github.com/dabeng/OrgChart">OrgChart</a> as the client-side web renderer.
